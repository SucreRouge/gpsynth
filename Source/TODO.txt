Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    Add command line for numPartials/valuemin/valuemax/LFOrange/greedyOverSelection or maybe keep in experiment
    command line for buffer size
    --help
    check argument ranges

GPFunctions.h:
    Define GP function as a class or struct with function, symbol, identity

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    change "200" to constant value, add command line flag, fix saveWavFile logic
    add more fitness functions/command line flag/constructor arg

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Add command to parse a network from a string
    Maybe remove mutateRemoveNode from command line arg as well
    Maybe remove mutateAddNode from command line arg as well
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    make initial population all unique (equals for GPNetwork and GPNode)
    make availableFunctions and availableTerminals pointers
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    
GPNode.h:
	Change name of GPNodeParams to GPNodeMutationParams

FunctionNode.cpp:
    maybe split into unaryFunctionNode.cpp and BinaryFunctionNode.cpp but prolly not
    change mutationcode to accoutn for types of arity functions

All node subclasses:
    mutate()
    equals()
