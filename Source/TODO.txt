Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    Add command line for fitness function type
    Add command line for numPartials/valuemin/valuemax/LFOrange
    --help

GPFunctions.h:
    Define GP function as a class with function, symbol, identity

GPExperiment.cpp:
	Delete Node subclasses added to nodeParams
    Figure out how to pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    do something with max-fitness
    change "200" to constant value, add command line flag, fix saveWavFile logic
    add more fitness functions/command line flag/constructor arg

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Implement mutateRemoveNode (maybe multiple versions)
    Implement mutateAddNode like typical GP would
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Take out nodeLikelihoods from GPNodeParams
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code
    Implement reproduce 3 and 4
    node remove chance
    
GPNode.h:
	Change name of GPNodeParams and move it to somewhere where it makes more sense with an RNG in it

Node subclasses:
