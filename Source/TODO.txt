Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    Add command line for numPartials/valuemin/valuemax/LFOrange
    --help

GPFunctions.h:
    Define GP function as a class with function, symbol, identity

GPExperiment.cpp:
	Delete Node subclasses added to nodeParams
    Figure out how to pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    change "200" to constant value, add command line flag, fix saveWavFile logic
    add more fitness functions/command line flag/constructor arg

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Add command to parse a network from a string
    Maybe remove mutateRemoveNode (maybe multiple versions)
    Maybe remove mutateAddNode
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    make initial population all unique (equals for GPNetwork and GPNode)
    make availableFunctions and availableTerminals pointers
    Take out nodeLikelihoods from GPNodeParams
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code
    Implement other types of reproduction
    node remove chance
    do TODOs

    REPRODUCTION:
        In a rare situation where the root of one parental s-expression is selected as the crossover point and the crossover fragment from the second parent is a snigle terminal, the first parent becomes one offspring and the other offspring will be a LISP S-expression consisting of the single terminal
    
GPNode.h:
	Change name of GPNodeParams to GPNodeMutationParams

FunctionNode.cpp:
    maybe split into unaryFunctionNode.cpp and BinaryFunctionNode.cpp but prolly not
    change mutationcode to accoutn for types of arity functions

All node subclasses:
    mutate()
    equals()
